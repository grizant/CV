\CourseEntry{Spring 2019}{STAT 446/646:~Introduction to Bayesian Statistics}{Led an undergraduate/graduate hybrid course in an introduction to Bayesian statistics. Proposed and developed the course using activity learning activities. Statistical inference using Bayes’ Theorem. Topics include Bayesian/frequentist comparison, posterior analysis for continuous and discrete random variables, prior specification, Bayesian regression, multivariate inference, and posterior sampling through Markov Chain Monte Carlo.

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\small{``Dr. Schissler is as much a life coach as he is statistician and instructor. On top of excellently conveying the information of the weekly lessons, he also routinely showed the class tools to be better prepared and organized in many other aspects of life. I look forward to his class next semester.''}}
\item \emph{\small{``Dr. Schissler is by far the best teacher I've had in any form of academia. He is very methodical as he maps out a day plan for each class and follows it well. He never tries to hide information from any student and is constantly encouraging his students to engage in the material and actively learn. He is very generous and always gives the benefit of the doubt to his students when errors are made on tests or homework. He is very approachable and
friendly to his students. He doesn't just lecture, he teaches. It has been a tremendous class thanks to Dr. Schissler, and I hope to have more classes taught by him in the future.''}}
\end{itemize}

\CourseEntry{Fall 2018}{STAT 445-645:~Introduction to Statistical Computing}{Led an undergraduate/graduate hybrid course in statistical computing. Developed course using both online and in-class activities. Topics include basic R programming, data analysis workflow, optimization, parallel computing, maximum likelihood estimation, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Monte Carlo studies, bootstrap, and advanced data visualization.

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\small{``He was an amazing professor. He really cared about his students and wanted their feedback to improve the course and his teaching. He
was extremely fair with grading and was very clear with what he expected us to be able to do. He was always there to help any student that needed it. I loved how he showed us stats on MiniTab and R\ldots''}}
\item \emph{\small{``One of the best professors I've ever had. He has a better teaching method than most, but understands that it needs some adjustment.
He completely overhauled his teaching method to ensure that the class learned his material. Truly showed love for teaching and
interest in making sure we walked away with the knowledge we needed[.]''}}

\CourseEntry{Spring 2018}{STAT 757:~Applied Regression Analysis}{Guided a class of 26 graduate students in applied regression analysis in R and R Markdown. Topics included simple and multiple linear regression, diagnostics/remediation, model selection, time series, logistic regression, and mixed effects modeling. Supervised 15 research projects during the course. Some student testimonials are included below:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\small{``This was one of the best courses I had outside my discipline. I liked the instructor's teaching style, knowledge, and candidness. He made a great impression on me and helped me improve several aspects of my learning style. He has great passion for what he does and it shows.''}}
\item \emph{\small{``Grant is very enthusiastic and helpful. The class was challenging, but I liked his approach to teaching it. Constantly pushing, and focused
on the learning rather than the grade. He was readily available to answer questions and you can tell he really enjoys his job/work. If he doesn't, he fakes it really well.''}}
\end{itemize}

\CourseEntry{Fall 2017}{MATH 330:~Linear Algebra}{Guided a class of 70+ upper-class undergraduate students to obtain/exceed linear algebra learning objectives. Developed a 'blended' approach to instruction, featuring flipped classroom elements along with collaborative in-class work sessions. Some student testimonials are included below:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\small{``Doctor Schissler cares very much about student success. He is empathetic, understanding, and passionate about the subject material! The flipped classroom approach takes some getting used to, but it does make the ``ah-ha'' moments when something clicks all the more satisfying.''}}
\item \emph{\small{``One of the best professors I've ever had. He has a better teaching method than most, but understands that it needs some adjustment.
